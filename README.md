<h1>Project Title</h1>
<h3>BookLover</h3>

<h1>Description</h1>
<h5>
Introducing an exceptional full-stack application that combines the power of Java and React: a responsive platform designed to revolutionize the way users interact with books.

With our application, users can effortlessly explore a vast collection of books, search by title or category, and dive into the world of literature. The intuitive checkout system enables users to easily borrow books, manage their checked-out items, and even renew the checkout period when needed.

But it doesn't stop there. We believe in the power of community, which is why we've incorporated a review feature that allows users to share their thoughts and opinions on the books they've read. These reviews are prominently displayed on each book's details page, creating an engaging and insightful environment for fellow bookworms.

To ensure a secure and personalized experience, we've integrated Okta for authentication purposes. Users can seamlessly create accounts, log in, and enjoy the benefits of a personalized profile. By generating JWT, OpenID, and OAuth2 functionalities and implementing secure HTTPS communication, we prioritize user privacy and data protection.

In addition, we've built an exclusive admin page for efficient book management. Admins have the power to add new books to the collection, delete existing ones, and even modify the quantity of available books. This ensures that the library is always up to date and can cater to the diverse interests of our users.

We understand the importance of communication, which is why we've included an internal messaging feature. Users can reach out to the admin directly, sharing their inquiries or suggestions. The admin, in turn, can respond promptly, ensuring a seamless connection between the library and its valued users.
